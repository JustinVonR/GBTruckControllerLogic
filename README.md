# Garbage Truck Controller Logic Simulation
This project was created as a mini code prototype for a college design class. The interface was created using the [p5.js Library](https://p5js.org/) and the site is using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### Instructions for Using the Code
If you want to try the simulation for yourself, follow the instructions below:
1. Open the website at [https://justinvonr.github.io/GBTruckControllerLogic/](https://justinvonr.github.io/GBTruckControllerLogic/)
2. Interact with the Simulation:
    - Click the rectangular buttons to activate them. The buttons turn green when on.
    - Press the space bar to simulate the truck stopping.
3. Watch the three indicators on the right side of the window to see what output the logic is currently giving.

> [!NOTE]
> This project will likely be taken down in a few months, so don't plan to come back to it too far in the future.
